      <p class="summary-text">
        Souffl√©s have a reputation for being temperamental, but they're actually
        very simple. They get their signature height from stiffly beaten egg
        whites. Using a few staple ingredients, you can whip up a chocolate
        dessert that's guaranteed to impress at a dinner party yet easy enough
        for a casual supper.

          <li>Unsalted butter, room temperature, for baking dish</li>
          <li>1/4 cup sugar, plus more for baking dish</li>
          <li>
            8 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped, or semisweet chocolate
            chips (1 cup)
          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>3 large egg yolks, lightly beaten, plus 4 large egg whites</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>

        <h4 class="h4-border">Directions...</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Step 1:Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter a 1 1/2-quart
            tall-sided baking dish. Coat with sugar, tapping out excess. Set
            dish on a rimmed baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 2:In a large heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water,
            combine chocolate, vanilla, and 1/4 cup water. Stir until chocolate
            is melted and mixture is smooth, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat
            and let cool to room temperature, 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 3:Stir egg yolks into cooled chocolate mixture until well
            combined. Set souffle base aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 4:In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites and
            cream of tartar on medium-high until soft peaks form, about 2
            minutes. Gradually add sugar and beat until stiff, glossy peaks
            form, about 5 minutes (do not overbeat).
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 5:In two additions, fold egg-white mixture into souffle base:
            With a rubber spatula, gently cut down through center and lift up
            some base from bottom of bowl. Turning bowl, steadily continue to
            cut down and lift up base until just combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Step 6:Transfer mixture to dish, taking care not to get batter on
            top edge of dish; smooth top. Bake souffle until puffed and set, 30
            to 35 minutes. (Do not open oven during first 25 minutes of baking.)
            Serve immediately.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Cook's Notes :</strong> Dust the finished souffle with
          confectioners' sugar if you like, then serve straight away -- the
          souffle will begin to lose its lift and collapse as it cools.
